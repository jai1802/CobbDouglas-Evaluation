# CobbDouglas-Evaluation
Evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the Cobb-Douglas Production Function from a macroeconomic perspective
***
A common method of modelling supply-side metrics in economics such as a company’s total production or a country’s GDP is the Cobb-Douglas function. This function can be manipulated and used as the basis of a linear regression. I look at how accurate this model is when it comes to modelling real-world data, and also identify and comment on macroeconomic trends regarding total factory productivity and efficiency in production over time
